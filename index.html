        <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is Ava and I am the owner of Home Away Services by Ava. I started this business in November of 2021 as just a small thing to do in my freetime around my neighborhood. I started with just house/pet sitting which turned into dog walking and more. Well it quickly grew and when I graduated in May of 2022 I decided to take my business public. I&apos;m so excited to share my journey with you all and my adventures with the wonderful people and animals that I work with!</p>

<p>My love of animals started early, I was about 5 when I got my first dog, and since then I have been obsessed with all animals. I&apos;ve lived with a cat, dogs, and fish. And I currently live with 3 dogs (2 Miniature Schnauzers and a Goldendoodle) and own two fish (an Oranda goldfish and a Butterfly Telescope goldfish). But I have been lucky enough to have worked with a variety of animals!</p>
